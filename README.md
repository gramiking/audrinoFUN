*Random Fun code for testing server rack lights


-Change the x.x.x.x to your IP if you are needing one. ie: webserver


-This script will play random LED designes on a 100 light string inside your server rack. Once the rack door is opened,
 the lights will switch to a ALL white LED for visibility on a 5 second loop. Once closed the rack will then continue 
 with the LED randomness.


It isn't perfect as it is my first script. Hopefully you can learn from it or optimize it and I can learn from you.


-Thanks D.
